# CIS21JA-x86-assembly
Course assignments for CIS21JA

Assignments 1 and 2 ain't here but I remember it was really simple if you pay attenton during classes, otherwise, watch youtube videos like me! If you have prior experience with other high-level programming languages ( Java, C++ ) you wouldn't have a problem with Assembly x86
